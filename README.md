# Future Considerations

For future versions of Colourfully, I plan to implement:

## Scaling
- Optimise image processing for larger files and higher volume
- Implement caching strategies to reduce API calls
- Add database storage for user history and preferences
- Consider serverless functions for better resource allocation

## Feature Enhancements
- Add export options (Adobe, Figma, CSS variables)
- Implement color accessibility scoring
- Create shareable palettes with unique URLs
- Add color naming with industry standards (Pantone, RAL)
- Develop browser extensions for capturing colors from any website
- Build mobile applications for on-the-go color capturing

## Monetization Paths
- Premium tier with advanced color analysis tools
- API access for developers to integrate color analysis
- Team collaboration features for design teams
