### Azure Image Analysis

We use [Microsoft Azure Image Analysis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) to process and analyze images uploaded by users. This service extracts visual information from images to generate a color palette. By using Colourfully, you agree to Azure's processing of your images in accordance with their [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/).

### node-palette

We also use [node-palette](https://github.com/Meodai/node-palette) to generate color palettes from images. This library processes image data locally on our servers and does not store or share your data.

### Clerk Auth

We use [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) to manage user authentication for Colourfully. When you sign in or create an account, Clerk may collect and process certain personal information, such as your email address, name, and profile picture. This information is used solely for authentication purposes and to provide a seamless user experience.

Clerk operates as a third-party service, and their handling of your data is governed by their own [Privacy Policy](https://clerk.dev/privacy). We recommend reviewing their privacy policy to understand how they manage your data.
